# Web Scrapers

This is the code from my web scraping guide on youtube. It includes two scrapers. One with Node.js and Puppeteer and one with Python and Beautiful Soup.

We scrape the website https://books.toscrape.com/ but you can change the code to scrape something else.

## Node.js & Puppeteer Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the file

```bash
node scrape
```

## Python & BS4 Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the file

```bash
python scrape.py
```
