# Web Scrapers

This is the code from my [web scraping guide on youtube](https://youtu.be/XMu46BRPLqA). It includes two scrapers. One with Node.js and Puppeteer and one with Python and Beautiful Soup.

We scrape the website https://books.toscrape.com/ but you can change the code to scrape something else.

## Node.js & Puppeteer Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
cd web-scraper-node
npm install
```

Run the file

```bash
node scrape
```

## Python & BS4 Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
cd web-scraper-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the file

```bash
python scrape.py
```
